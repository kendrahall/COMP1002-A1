			<blockquote>
			<p>Computers have changed the world in many ways. They allow huge amounts of information to be stored in a small space. They also allow a person to calculate mathematical problems with ease. Finally, computers allow people to communicate with one another through internet sites such as Facebook, My Space, and Twitter.</p>
			<p>Computers have changed the way people view information. Previously, people wanted to store their information, such as work documents, and be able to access them again when the computer was turned back on. Now people can store documents, watch movies, read books, make telephone calls, get directions, access bank accounts, download and store music, and a multitude of other things all with a computer.</p>
			<p>Finally, computers have changed the way that we communicate as a society.  People can now talk to one another in almost no time at all through the use of social networking sites, and people can even live video chat with applications such as Skype.  Imagine, if this idea had been presented to scientist 50 years ago, the presenter would have been laughed out of the conversation.</p>
